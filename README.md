# diffcp

`diffcp` is a Python package for computing the derivative of a convex cone program, with respect to its problem data. The derivative is implemented as an abstract linear map, with methods for its forward application and its adjoint. 

The implementation is based on the calculations in our paper [Differentiating through a cone program](http://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/diff_cone_prog.html).

### Installation
`diffcp` is available on PyPI, as a source distribution. Install it with

```bash
pip install diffcp
```

You will need a C++11-capable compiler to build `diffcp`.

`diffcp` requires:
* [NumPy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy) >= 1.15
* [SciPy](https://github.com/scipy/scipy) >= 1.10
* [SCS](https://github.com/bodono/scs-python) >= 2.0.2
* [pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11/tree/stable) >= 2.4
* [threadpoolctl](https://github.com/joblib/threadpoolctl) >= 1.1
* [ECOS](https://github.com/embotech/ecos-python) >= 2.0.10
* [Clarabel](https://github.com/oxfordcontrol/Clarabel.rs) >= 0.5.1
* Python >= 3.7

`diffcp` uses Eigen; Eigen operations can be automatically vectorized by compilers. To enable vectorization, install with

```bash
MARCH_NATIVE=1 pip install diffcp
```

OpenMP can be enabled by passing extra arguments to your compiler. For example, on linux, you can tell gcc to activate the OpenMP extension by specifying the flag "-fopenmp":

```bash
OPENMP_FLAG="-fopenmp" pip install diffcp
```

To enable both vectorization and OpenMP (on linux), use

```bash
MARCH_NATIVE=1 OPENMP_FLAG="-fopenmp" pip install diffcp
```

### Cone programs
`diffcp` differentiates through a primal-dual cone program pair. The primal problem must be expressed as 

```
minimize        c'x + x'Px
subject to      Ax + s = b
                s in K
```
where  `x` and `s` are variables, `A`, `b`, `c` and `P` (optional) are the user-supplied problem data, and `K` is a user-defined convex cone. The corresponding dual problem is

```
minimize        b'y + x'Px
subject to      Px + A'y + c == 0
                y in K^*
```

with dual variable `y`.

### Usage

`diffcp` exposes the function

```python
solve_and_derivative(A, b, c, cone_dict, warm_start=None, solver=None, P=None, **kwargs).
```

This function returns a primal-dual solution `x`, `y`, and `s`, along with
functions for evaluating the derivative and its adjoint (transpose).
These functions respectively compute right and left multiplication of the derivative
of the solution map at `A`, `b`, `c` and `P` by a vector.
The `solver` argument determines which solver to use; the available solvers
are `solver="SCS"`, `solver="ECOS"`, and `solver="Clarabel"`.
If no solver is specified, `diffcp` will choose the solver itself.
In the case that the problem is not solved, i.e. the solver fails for some reason, we will raise
a `SolverError` Exception.

#### Arguments
The arguments `A`, `b`, `c` and `P` correspond to the problem data of a cone program.
* `A` must be a [SciPy sparse CSC matrix](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.csc_matrix.html).
* `b` and `c` must be NumPy arrays.
* `cone_dict` is a dictionary that defines the convex cone `K`.
* `warm_start` is an optional tuple `(x, y, s)` at which to warm-start. (Note: this is only available for the SCS solver).
* `P` is an optional [SciPy sparse CSC matrix](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.csc_matrix.html). (Note: this is currently only available for the Clarabel and SCS solvers, paired with LPGD differentiation mode).
* `**kwargs` are keyword arguments to forward to the solver (e.g., `verbose=False`).

These inputs must conform to the [SCS convention](https://github.com/bodono/scs-python) for problem data. The keys in `cone_dict` correspond to the cones, with
* `diffcp.ZERO` for the zero cone,
* `diffcp.POS` for the positive orthant,
* `diffcp.SOC` for a product of SOC cones,
* `diffcp.PSD` for a product of PSD cones, and
* `diffcp.EXP` for a product of exponential cones.

The values in `cone_dict` denote the sizes of each cone; the values of `diffcp.SOC`, `diffcp.PSD`, and `diffcp.EXP` should be lists. The order of the rows of `A` must match the ordering of the cones given above. For more details, consult the [SCS documentation](https://github.com/cvxgrp/scs/blob/master/README.md).

To enable [Lagrangian Proximal Gradient Descent (LPGD)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05920) differentiation of the conic program based on efficient finite-differences, provide one of the `mode=[lpgd, lpgd_left, lpgd_right]` options along with the argument `derivative_kwargs=dict(tau=0.1, rho=0.1)` to specify the perturbation and regularization strength. Alternatively, the derivative kwargs can also be passed directly to the returned `derivative` and `adjoint_derivative` function.

#### Return value
The function `solve_and_derivative` returns a tuple

```python
(x, y, s, derivative, adjoint_derivative)
```

* `x`, `y`, and `s` are a primal-dual solution.

* `derivative` is a function that applies the derivative at `(A, b, c, P)` to perturbations `dA`, `db`, `dc` and `dP` (optional). It has the signature 
```derivative(dA, db, dc, dP=None) -> dx, dy, ds```, where `dA` is a SciPy sparse CSC matrix with the same sparsity pattern as `A`, `db` and `dc` are NumPy arrays, and `dP` is an optional SciPy sparse CSC matrix with the same sparsity pattern as `P` (Note: currently only supported for LPGD differentiation mode). `dx`, `dy`, and `ds` are NumPy arrays, approximating the change in the primal-dual solution due to the perturbation.

* `adjoint_derivative` is a function that applies the adjoint of the derivative to perturbations `dx`, `dy`, `ds`. It has the signature 
```adjoint_derivative(dx, dy, ds, return_dP=False) -> dA, db, dc, (dP)```, where `dx`, `dy`, and `ds` are NumPy arrays. `dP` is only returned when setting `return_dP=True` (Note: currently only supported for LPGD differentiation mode).

#### Example
```python
import numpy as np
from scipy import sparse

import diffcp

cone_dict = {
    diffcp.ZERO: 3,
    diffcp.POS: 3,
    diffcp.SOC: [5]
}

m = 3 + 3 + 5
n = 5

A, b, c = diffcp.utils.random_cone_prog(m, n, cone_dict)
x, y, s, D, DT = diffcp.solve_and_derivative(A, b, c, cone_dict)

# evaluate the derivative
nonzeros = A.nonzero()
data = 1e-4 * np.random.randn(A.size)
dA = sparse.csc_matrix((data, nonzeros), shape=A.shape)
db = 1e-4 * np.random.randn(m)
dc = 1e-4 * np.random.randn(n)
dx, dy, ds = D(dA, db, dc)

# evaluate the adjoint of the derivative
dx = c
dy = np.zeros(m)
ds = np.zeros(m)
dA, db, dc = DT(dx, dy, ds)
```
